**A fast-paced guide to designing and building scalable and maintainable web apps with React.js**

## What is this book about?
Building web applications with maintainable and performant user interfaces is a challenge that many have faced for more than a decade, but no one has risen to this challenge quite like React.js. Today React.js is used by Facebook, Instagram, Khan Academy, and Imperial College London, to name a few. Many new users recognize the benefits of React.js and adopt it in their own projects, forming a fast-growing community. The speed at which React.js has evolved promises a bright future for those who invest in learning it today.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Install powerful React.js tools to make development much more efficient 
* Create React elements with properties and children 
* Get started with stateless and stateful React components 
* Use JSX to speed up your React.js development process 
* Add reactivity to your React components with lifecycle methods
